# Module-2---CSS-Mini-Projects

Mini Project 1 and 2 from Module 1, are extended by applying CSS features.
I have created projects using html and css properties as per the coursebook instructions provided by Talent Battle.
Here the internal CSS is used for each page.

Note : the projects are not responsive, responsive projects will be uploaded in bootstrap module.
